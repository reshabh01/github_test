test 1 for adding and commiting

used codes for previous commit and current commit

git add .
git commit -m "<message>"
git push



how i go revert in previous commit

git reset <previous_commit_id>
either delete previous things or git stash
git add .
git commit -m "<message>"
git push -f origin main    // used for forced update becuz it on simple push it was showing Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
